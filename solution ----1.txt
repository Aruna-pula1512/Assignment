Step 1: Set Up Local Kubernetes Cluster
Follow the same instructions for setting up Minikube or Kind as previously mentioned.

Step 2: Deploy the Services
Follow the same deployment steps provided earlier. Ensure you have your Kubernetes YAML files ready to deploy both the frontend and backend services.

Step 3: Automated Testing
Create a Python Test Script:
You can use the requests library to check the integration between the frontend and backend services.
import requests

def test_frontend_integration():
    frontend_url = 'http://<frontend-service-url>'
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(frontend_url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        if 'Greeting from backend' in response.text:
            print('Test passed: Frontend correctly displays the backend message.')
        else:
            print('Test failed: Message does not match.')

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f'Error connecting to frontend: {e}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_frontend_integration()
Install Required Dependencies:
If you haven't done so, install the requests library. You can do this using pip.
pip install requests
Step 4: Documentation
Create a README.md File:
# QA Test Project

## Setup Instructions

This project demonstrates deploying a frontend and backend service to a local Kubernetes cluster and testing their integration using Python.

### Prerequisites
- Minikube or Kind installed
- kubectl installed
- Python 3.x installed
- pip installed

### Deployment

1. Start your local Kubernetes cluster:
   ```bash
   minikube start

2.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Vengatesh-m/qa-test.git
cd qa-test
3.Deploy the services:
kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
4.Access the frontend service:
minikube service frontend --url

Running Automated Tests
Install dependencies:
pip install requests
Run the test script:
python test.py
Step 5: Publish to GitHub
Create a new GitHub repository ( it's public).
Push your code:
bash

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
